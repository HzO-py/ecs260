In my experience, people with high rep don't get extra upvotes with no effort.  Weak, wrong answers get ferreted out regardless of the rep of the person who wrote the answer.  If a question fails to get an authoritative answer it is usually obvious by the lack of voting.  Sometimes, it can take a day or three for a true expert in game X to show up, but when they do, the whole tenor of a question can change and voting patterns shift."

I guess that is the difference between theory and reality. Hard data can be obtained by people. They could estimate their average amount of plays per board game, and arrive at a $/hour figure (statistics, damn lies, and lies).

You are working on a false assumption - that game recommendations made by an expert and a layman dont differ. I strongly disagree. An expert, for example game designer, knows what game elements make it good for certain types of players and their preferences, how game mechanics translate to game dynamics and experience, what makes a game a gateway game etc. He can intelligently make and argument for his answer. A layman doesnt even have a vocabulary to do so, he just says: it worked for me." CreationDate="2013-11-13T12:55:25.283" UserId="5223" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Let's take the hypothetical where WotC decides it's losing money on printing and distribution of physical MTG product, so for all future sets they are going to be released digital only (I know this sounds crazy). That would mean any questions regarding mechanics in these sets would be off-topic on B&amp;CG.SE because there is no longer a physical implementation of the game. However, given the structure of MTG _as a game_, it fits more closely with this community than Arqade. This would also seem to hold for HS."
