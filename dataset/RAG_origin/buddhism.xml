The idea that we have to censor or redact Mahayana sutras because they are perceived as somehow &quot;politically incorrect&quot; by modern standards is a bit silly. &quot;Hinayana&quot; simply means small vehicle, and this isn't derogatory, at all. Since it's a much more demanding path to say, Pure Land, and requires amazing discipline, concentration, and training, with its goal of arahantship it's quite logical to call it &quot;smaller&quot;; not smaller in worth but smaller in scope because it embraces less people.
