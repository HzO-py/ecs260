Saying the &quot;only difference&quot; between an RC airplane and a 777 is scale is like saying the only difference between a salt water fish tank and the Pacific Ocean is scale. The issue is that the scale is _so different_ that it changes almost everything, including the aerodynamics. I don't think it's really fair to compare RC quadcopters with military UAVs, either, since the latter are usually on the scale of a normal, full-size airplane and, thus, have the aerodynamics of normal airplanes."
