Someone, somewhere, surely has tried to figure out how to cite a box of slides, a ham radio transmission, or a town crier. The &quot;standard&quot; answer is to find the closest thing actually in the style guide and then try to mimic that style as close you can, making appropriate changes, but that certainly can lead to discussion as to what the closest thing is and how to adapt it. For example, is a box of slides more similar to a filmstrip, a movie, or a book composed entirely of illustrations?"

So if you, me, and @Buffy agree on something, we can probably push it through. I'm good with `political-opinion` and `departmental politics` (which came from your answer). I think we can write the tag guidance for `political-opinion` in such a way to make clear that it includes the question you linked (professors engaging in campaign work is an offshoot of their political opinions).
